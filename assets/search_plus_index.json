    "body": "Thanks to the sheer existence of AJATT and further popularization of its ideas by numerous “modernized” regurgitations, people who start learning Japanese now have never been at quite as huge of a historical advantage over language learners of any other era. Obviously, humans were in fact doing immersion way before AJATT, however in the not-so-distant past you would’ve had to have been an aristocrat in order to go to a different country for a few years (or maybe a pirate, or some sort of inquisitor), and by the time the internet became usable and enabled media-based immersion… the business machine of academic language education had completely won over common sense and the not-so-eldritch knowledge of immersion being a thing was made lost to all but a very select few. Luckily, recently tables have started to turn. Unless you do literally no research before and during venturing into a foreign language, you are absolutely doomed to come across AJATT ideas at some point, be it the AJATT itself or its franchising branches. The AJATT is not really a language program/course, although it can (and is intended to) be interpreted as one. If anything, it’s a blog. And a huge mess. It is also free. Its clones are anything but free, and are sold as “revolutionary” courses. They all give you the same exact key to fluency, technically applicable to any language, but originally designed around Japanese (and very much still remaining this way) mostly because Japanese is also… well, sorta the best language for it. Except for maybe English, but I assume you speak it already. I would say Korean is definitely the third most suited for AJATT-esque approach language, followed by Cantonese and Mandarin (one I assume has better content, the other I assume has moar content), maybe followed by Thai and a few other… after that AJATT as a method gets drastically less applicable. Here I should note however that English, being the easiest language in the world (as well as one of the dumbest and least expressible), doesn’t really require any of the AJATT tools in order to be mastered: you can learn how to read English in a day or two, and from there you are free to just immerse — you don’t need any special tools for that. For Japanese immersion though: you better stop by the armory before you embark. Most people learning languages other than Japanese are obviously far less likely to encounter ajatt&amp;copycats. Especially for non-English speakers, but I am sure AJATT alternatives exist in most languages already. One of the first known “AJATTs” was actually written, I think, by a Polish dude about learning English… so yeah, the alternatives have in fact been out there even before the AJATT itself. I am also sure that most of them are hidden behind paywalls under pretense of containing some sort of secret and very exclusive knowledge for cool people eyes’ only. I really recommend against following neither AJATT nor its “forks”. Except for the core message any real polyglot can give you for free — immersion is king — you really shouldn’t follows any of the AJATT-y gurus (including the madhouse that is the original AJATT) to a T: not even close to it, in fact. Especially if you’re a complete beginner and would pretty much have no choice but to completely trust everything they say and blindly do what you’re told. Bad idea. Let me explain why. It will take a while."

    "body": "IMMERSION IS THE ONLY ROAD TO FLUENCY. OBVIOUSLY RELIGION — MAYBE NOT I will talk about the immersion itself later, but allow me to bitch about ajatt&amp;friends first, since you’ve probably heard about them and may possibly be considering joining the cult. Obviously there can be no exchange of ideas between us if you are already following their teachings, but if I can warn even one person who’s about to dive deep into that sea of misguidedness, I’ll consider my time typing this essay spent rather well. The problem with AJATT is that while is does correctly identify the core principle of acquiring real fluency, its over-the-top fanatical cult-like approach is blind to way too many real world factors, which leads to a tad too many pulled-straight-outta-ass conclusions about its own effectiveness based on absolutely nothing but pride, wishful thinking, and general immature drunken overconfidence backed up by nothing but “discovering” one on-point idea. That’s exactly what “good” cults do though: tell one big on-the-nose universal truth to lure you in; proceed to weave a web of bullshit justifications around it for why you need to enroll NOW. I don’t recommend starting with AJATT to anyone precisely because of that. It is a diary of a madman (and quite a bit of a conman, too) who’s kinda sorta right about certain things… but is cutting my hair short and wearing these dirty white robes really necessary for purification of my chromosomes? I honestly don’t think most of AJATT “teachings” are correct, let alone practical. Is there some truth to them? Yes. Are there at least some good ideas for language learners there? Yes, but AJATT is not the first source to come up with them and I’ll give you pretty much all of them in a minute anyway, in a way more curated and digestible form. If you’re an absolute beginner at learning languages and go into ajatt&amp;friends with blind faith — I am super worried that you won’t be able to filter out the bs, especially the biggest piles of it (the obviously idiotic ideas of the original AJATT teachings can probably be filtered out by most adults) and end up wasting immeasurable amount of your very much finite time and effort on absolutely useless practices and rituals. All kinds of which they’ve got to tell you aaaaaaaall about. Thу correct core idea which AJATT managed to get precisely right is very simple, and it is something polyglots knew for ages (at least) but at some point people stopped listening to them because: following the polyglot way would’ve meant trying something opposing what most people already believe and invested in, and most people are simply incapable of such advanced actions; sunk cost butthurt. if when tried the polyglot way turned out correct (and it is) it would’ve meant that an uncountable amount of time and money was wasted by generations of people blindly following the “traditional” academic approach to studying languages. people reeeally hate being proven wrong. simply being wrong doesn’t bother them all that much. “The School of Traditional Academic Approach”, lead by people calling themselves “linguists”, is essentially a scam: First of all, you don’t need to go far nor dig deep to find overwhelming evidence of it Not. Working. I am talking about all the cases of people spending around a decade (or more/several) studying a given language yet still not being capable of consuming any native-level content, let alone participating in native-level conversations (and they never will be capable of that, unfortunately), convinced they are doing everything right and “it just takes time, bro, you know. my sister’s been studying Japanese since high school, you know. she’s 35 now and she recently went to Tokyo: she said she couldn’t understand a single thing there. languages hard, bro”. That is just criminal idiocy: becoming fluent in any language doesn’t take a lifetime. Even if you don’t study full-time. Those who say that it is absolutely normal to spend half a life acquiring one additional language and that that is exactly how it should be are either lying or spreading a lie, on top of being top-notch moronically oblivious to how they acquired their first one (also, in their case definitely the last one). There is absolutely nothing common or traditional about the “traditional” academic approach. Chances are you speak at least one language natively. Do you remember how much time it took to become fluent in it? And did you do any book study before you could speak and effortlessly understand it? Who told you only babies can do that? Could it have been someone monolingual? A language tutor selling you their services, perhaps? The true path to acquiring a language is immersion, and you’ve already been down it: it’s the same one you took when acquiring your first language. The kind of immersion a modern polyglot would recommend you is somewhat artificial in nature, yet fake it is not. Indeed real it is. Instead of going to a foreign country and forcing your brain to learn the language out of need to survive and function in society — you make the country, along with its language, come to you through the power of consumerism media content. By far the best thing about artificial immersion is that it is actually much more productive (also cheaper and safer) than the old school “lemme go some place where no one speaks my language, that’ll sure learn me a new one” way of doing it. The classic method is by far the next best thing though, undeniably: it’s been very popular with those who take languages seriously… since forever, really. Probably because before the internet it was not only the best but also the only way of becoming fluent in a foreign language. Polyglots have always known that book/class study was a waste of time (and a scam), so I guess over a few centuries of world travel being possible the idea of “professionals say extended stay in the country of your target language is the best way to become fluent” has at least a little bit became somewhat of a public assumption. Welp, classic immersion is way more problematic in modern era: countries are way more paranoid about letting foreigners in for extended stay. In fact, extended stay is pretty much impossible unless you’re in the country as a student or on a very cereal, highly professional and official business. In addition to that, current younger generations are extremely poor on top of also being jobless most of the time (thanks for leaving us nothing, boomers), so travel, let alone international studenthood, is out of the question for most of us. Artificial immersion is the knew, better, and more accessible solution to the language acquisition gatekeeping. It only became possible about maybe 15 years ago with availability of relatively fast and uncapped home internet. Totally hot new thing, optimized just for you by a 17 year-old language genius who is yet to leave their parents’ basement this year. Only $299.99 $14.99 a month for the discord server access. Dude we have so much based stuff there like omg you have to join. This guide is about learning Japanese, but its ideas can be applied to learning any other language. For some, like the Chinese languages, the application is going to be borderline identical. For most other languages: you could probably skip about 50% of the modern Japanese/Chinese polyglot-method-learner’s toolkit. By which I am mainly referring to SRS (covered later). I will mention this point again before talking in detail about it."

Generally speaking I am still not very good: I mean, since I never read — mostly because I can’t — you can probably imagine the size of my vocabulary, right? I can sure understand scripted, heavily annunciated instances of Japanese thought! Mostly anime, watching which is literally all I have done with my teens and 20s. For any actual real Japanese I understand enough to get the general message, and then I just ignore everything I don’t understand: works most of the time. Never lived to Japan, of course, and to be honest — not a huge fan. Not anime enough. It’s not like I could function outside of this basement, anyway. if every “star” polyglot on YouTube was honest"

    "body": "You need to learn at least some basics first. Along with RTK (talked about in the next segment), avoiding learning any grammar is one the biggest moronisms of AJATT. So you’re gonna legit push for starting immersion without even knowing what です and -ます mean, or how particles are used? Oh, you say it’s not important in the long run anyway? Shut up. Go to your room. I seem to remember there being something about comprehendible input in the “science department” of AJATT… Must be imagining things. Clearly if comprehension was the core of your method you would’ve advised people to at first get at least some sort of familiarity with how the language works, so that they could stand at least some kind of chance comprehending at least something in their immersion. As opposed to, I dunno know, literally nothing? Yeah, so much comprehension. Very input. Getting smarter every minute, no doubt. That is yet another display of lacking self-awareness that almost every AJATT guru shares: they completely ignore the fact they they themselves had actually been with the language for quite some time before they went full immersion after giving up on other study methods. Meaning: they were very familiar with the basics by the time they moved to immersion and were able to comprehend random bits and pieces. They themselves didn’t actually do the “no grammar cold start”… But they would like you to do it. Because…? Well, that’s what selling language courses on redtube is all about, I suppose: you just come up with things that you’d like to be true and then push them as truth. You see, when you know everything you don’t really require any kind of evidence for you theories: they just automatically become reality… as long as you don’t leave your discord server. Japanese from Zero, book 1 is by far the best place to start. That book is an absolute, one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Written by a mad lad polyglot truly in love with helping people get good. If you absolutely cannot wait to get into immersion, feel free to stop at book 1, but I recommend going through book 2 as well before doing anything else (even though it is not as insanely good and useful as the first one). After book 2 JFZ starts becoming progressively less mind-blowingly useful, but I wouldn’t say there is absolutely no value in books 3 and even 4. Book 5, however, is where I draw the line: by book 5 all the basic grammar is covered, but the remainder of the advanced-ish grammar in the language is so vast that one book could only cover maybe like 5% of it. So, the book covers pretty much nothing of what you want to know at that point: just a few random things. Whether you read it or not doesn’t make any difference, really. IMHO book 5 should’ve just been about how to study further by yourself (kind of what this website is). I also recommend learning hiragana and katakana (along with some very basic vocab) like a normal human being in a few days instead of following the “progressive” system of the first two JFZ books: a very questionable invention of the author, to be honest. Although, in his defense: the book was written for all possible Japanese learners and not just for geniuses like you and I. Some of those learners include people who just want to study as much basic grammar as fast as possible so that they could be じょうず’ed by their way out-of-their-league crushes Japanese classmates. So give the author some break, mmkay? Without the progressive system… It would take some people maybe even a whole week (!!!) to learn kana — they need the ability to learn grammar and vocab NOW, goddammit! JFZ hears. JFZ provides. I don’t blame. Much. I should mention that the author has quite a few other inventions as well: I find all of them rather brilliant, and fully support his “unorthodox” (i.e. correct) approach to defining and explaining a lot of grammar (something that by the “official” mainstream linguistics is fucked up beyond belief). If you want to continue learning grammar points after JFZ book 2, along (or instead of) books 3 and 4 I suggest you get some of the TRY! books. Trust me, I’ve seen a lot of Japanese grammar books, and most of them are absolute trash. The TRY! series is not only not half bad — it is actually pretty OK. Alternatively, especially if you are on a limited budget, you can just start parsing the japanesetest4you.com website. JFZ is still my “№1 place to start before you do anything else” recommendation though."

    "body": "AS A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF MISSING THE FOREST FOR THE TREES This is where things get tricky for a while. You see, written and spoken Japanese are essentially two separate languages. Knowing how a word sounds will tell you absolutely nothing about how it is written, and vice versa. And you can’t “just learn kanji, stupid” because with very few exceptions knowing some possible readings and meanings of a kanji is not going to allow you to actually read nor understand words you don’t already know that contain said kanji. A kanji is basically just a picture. Or rather, every written word is a picture: and most of them consist of several kanji. Or kanji plus kana of course (in which case the kana part would be referred to as okurigana) but kana being there isn’t going to help you much if the kanji part is unknown to you. In similar fashion: knowing how some of the kanji characters can be read and interpreted will not enable you to read new words phonetically, let alone understand what kind of final meaning is implied by most kanji compounds (which, if it’s a word you don’t know, can always be interpreted in dozens of completely different ways). In order to be able to read complete words — you need to know those specific words. There is no other way, no system behind it that you can master to unlock the “Japanese reading skill”: kanji is not really an alphabet. Or at least not a one that can be just read. Readings are implied, and are subject to interpretation (which actually does vary in different parts of Japan). Even extensive knowledge of all kanji characters wouldn’t help much: what you need to know is combinations of them. You need to know the words, not the kanji. By words I mostly mean 熟語 of course (jukugo, kanji compounds), but Japanese also has a lot of words with okurigana (mainly verbs and adjectives) that use the same kanji, but different kana (and in some cases different readings of that same kanji too), and have very different meanings and don’t follow any particular patterns (like the somewhat predictable 自動詞 / 他動詞 patterns, for example). So you wouldn’t be able to differentiate between what they mean using your oh-so-valuable extensive kanji knowledge… unless you just remember. 探(さが)す and 探(さぐ)る come to mind. So it’s not just the compounds: it’s all words in general that you just have to remember, one-by-one. Don’t get me wrong though, knowing various stuff about various kanji is cool: it allows you to appreciate the language and the culture on a substantially deeper level. All I’m saying is that knowledge about the kanji of the word and knowledge of the word don’t come in the same package. At all. I really need you to understand that before not even just giving you any kanji learning recommendation, but actually making the whole idea a choice: something you in fact may want to consider not bothering with (meaning, separately studying kanji). I told you things are getting tricky, right? Well, I have finally became my own worst enemy: a highly questionable language guru. AJATT&amp;associates all push for no grammar, and I am about to push for no kanji. Controversial enough? This is going to be your situation. You’ve gone through a few grammar books, maybe. You realize you can’t read for shit anyways. You decide to learn at least some kanji before attempting any reading (because you tried and you couldn’t, like, pretty much at all). Well, yeah, you could do that. In fact, you probably should. There is never (unfortunately) a good excuse not to know at least some of the basic ones. Even if you went to the lowest class of a Japanese language school, they would look at you as a mentally deficient one if you didn’t know words/kanji like 木、人、日、月、etc (about 100-150 super basic ones). So your choices are: Remembering the Kanji There is this relatively popular book about kanji being heavily promoted by ajatt&amp;co called Remembering the Kanji (RTK for close friends and family). Its method does precisely that and absolutely nothing more. You’ll just be familiar with how most kanji look and know one (lol) meaning for each (because it’s the only way to remember them all in a reasonable amount of time). By itself — absolutely useless information, but technically all it’s intended to do is ease you into the process of looking up and memorizing words in kanji (something you’ll be doing all the time) you’d otherwise have no point of reference for, and therefore (in theory) they would be much more difficult to remember. I’ve never tried this method and don’t really want to. I sincerely doubt the author speaks any Japanese (or Chinese, for that matter), because the original idea behind RTK was to give the non-Chinese learners of Japanese the same advantage the Chinese-speaking learners have. To close the gap, so to speak. Which (the advantage), was spectacularly misidentified as familiarity with kanji. How can you miss such a giant target is beyond me. The author clearly had no idea what he was talking about. The advantage does exist, and it’s huge. Gigantic, even. But it isn’t familiarity with the alphabet. It is the fact that Chinese and Japanese share most 熟語, most of which have the same meaning, too. How little do you have to know about not only Japanese (of which I assume the author is some kind of guru?) but also Chinese to not understand how reading them works? According to his logic, I assume he speaks most European languages too, since he is already familiar with most of their alphabets. What a legend. Studying kanji is like a separate discipline that has almost nothing to do with studying Japanese itself. “Remembering” kanji… I dunno, it might help a little bit, might not help at all. It’s an option to consider, I suppose? From what I heard, it takes about 2-3 months to “remember” all the kanji you won’t be able to use anyway for the foreseeable future until you forget most of them unless you read and memorize words (so just do the last part, you know, the part that will actually enable you to use the language you’re learning). I guess that means about 2500? Or maybe 4000? Again, no idea. All I know is that you will never be in this kind of situation: “Oh poor me… If only I knew what this kanji meant I would’ve been able to understand this word. not read though: just understand. for some reason I don’t care about the phonetic part of this language”. In 99.99% of cases — no. Even if the ultimate meaning of the word is related to the combination of meanings of its kanji characters — there could be dozens of potential interpretations of a given combination and you’ll never guess the correct one. Here, I give you two words: “human” and “murder”. Well, what meaning do they make? Homicide? Murderer? Dead body? A homicide victim? A person who “screams murder”? Shall I go on? Not everything is as straightforward as “bread”, “human”, and “make”. Let’s talk politics. 政治 せいじ. Ok, so you remembered™ 政 as “politics”, good for you. But let me guess, you probably remembered™ 治 as “heal” or “repair”, right? So wtf is it in the end? politics+repair… Could it mean “a political reform”, perhaps? No? Confusing much? How are you supposed to interpret that as just “politics”? By learning the damn word, and not just remembering™ its individual kanji. Trust me, by the time you know most of the words, you will know most of the kanji. However, it doesn’t work the other way around. Not even a little bit. Ok, so you keep staring at an unfamiliar word. You may not have any available, but at least hypothetically what would be your options? You can of course try guessing the word’s meaning from context, but for that you don’t need any familiarity with its kanji™: in order to do that you need to know the rest (or most) of the words in the sentence. Yet again — no matter how we rotate it, the solution keeps coming back to having to know words, and not just being familiar with characters. One English word per kanji doesn’t even translate to its meaning btw: that’s why I call it familiarity rather than knowing the meaning. One kanji can have several absolutely different meanings, or just like the, you know, words themselves, a kanji can represent a concept/idea that in English can only be described with maybe a dozen sentences, not just one word. And you are just going to assign one word to it and somehow be able to use that “knowledge” to… do what, even? Doing several months of RTK™ does nothing for you in the long run: the meta game of learning written Japanese is word memorization. You may think that’s way too shallow, surface level approach, but any Japanese learner can tell you that’s literally all there is to it. When you see a word you don’t know: it is never about the meaning of its kanji. You can, however, try to derive both reading and meaning from the kanji’s radicals even if you are seeing these kanji for the first time. Both guesses can only be made if you have enough knowledge of words (熟語), and not just what the damn characters mean (which doesn’t even matter in over half the words). And in relation to the hypothetical situation I’ve just described: shall I repeat that when it comes to readings RTK ignores that part completely? And shall I restate that one English word of “meaning” does not describe even 50% of what most kanji stand for? In tons of cases you’d actually need several Japanese words to describe them. And those Japanese words combined would require dozens of English words if you were to describe them all in English. What exactly are you getting from that one English word you are remembering™? And what about all the different kanji that mean literally the same thing? Are you going to remember 止 as “stop” and 留 as… What? Not moving? Or maybe Russian ruble? Yeah that’ll do you good in the long run. And 停 as what? Halt? But 止 isn’t? Wow, it’s almost like remembering kanji separately from words makes absolutely no sense and is a complete waste of time. (trying and failing to) Actually Remember (some) Kanji (before losing your mind and giving up)™ Studying kanji (readings+meanings), one at a time, pretty much the same way you would do words (talked about later), giving up after about 400-600, exhausted and frustrated moving on to reading and pure word memorization. This was pretty much my path. I don’t recommend wasting time on the first part. The reason I finally gave up was because between knowing about 300 and 600 kanji there was little to no difference in my (terrible) reading ability. At that time I was intensively becoming more and more busy with various grownup life bs, so as soon as I started to suspect a substantial lack of connection between reading ability and kanji familiarity I decided to stop studying kanji as part of daily routine. I have been slightly less unhappy ever since. Be smart and value your time Studying the first 100 or so kanji (probably about 300, to be honest) and happily moving on to reading and word memorization. I recommend you do that. the Not Worth It™ option Keep on studying 2000+ kanji in parallel to all your other Japanese activities until you are more or less done with either life or Japanese. That was my initial plan. I don’t recommend it: it would consume way too much of your time in the long run — the time you’d be MUCH BETTER OFF spending reading and memorizing words. If you want to properly learn all* kanji it would probably take about 2 years of doing literally nothing else full-time, but probably even longer. However, if you did that… you would probably earn one monster of a vocab? So I guess if Japanese application of Chinese characters is literally the most interesting thing in the world for you, I wouldn’t say there are no benefits to studying it. *2000 is a lie: you’re going to need significantly more if you plan on hitting that elusive reading fluency, especially if Japanese names is something you want to be able to work with, like, at all. You should be aware, however, that knowing all kanji is not something most native Japanese speakers expect even from each other, let alone a stupid filthy gaijin. And even though a regular Japanese person can obviously read a crap ton more than 2200 kanji — it is quite a painful, and definitely not very fun process for them when things get really kanji-heavy (not unlike how reading without furigana feels to you now). Oh, at some point MattVSJapan could read better than some natives? Yeah, well, he specifically trained himself with SRS to know all the obscure kanji most Japanese people see maybe once a year if not even less often. Once he starts living a normal life he will quickly forget most of the 10000000+ obsolete kanji he once learned for literally no reason and his reading ability will gradually go down to a normal Japanese person’s level, which isn’t really all that high The only point in continuing studying kanji after you know about 200 that contributes to your reading ability is that you’ll be picking up vocab along your studies. Useful? Yes. The most productive application of your study time? No, not really. Regarding sources to get your first couple hundred kanji from — just use whatever you can find (as long at it’s not wanikani, duolingo, or any other obvious scam website). Internet search can probably point you towards tools that are slightly less outdated than what I can think of, so here are some just very fundamental things: Offline dictionaries can be useful: definitely get imiwa? if you have an iOS device. All offline dictionaries on Android are equally terrible, so I just use —&gt; Jisho.org is your new best friend. All information on anything word- or kanji- related can be found in this online dictionary. A bunch of grammar as well, actually. Kanji flashcards are much more useful than kanji books. The sets I used (and still do occasionally, on rare days when I don’t quite feel miserable enough) are from White Rabbit Press: can’t say too many bad things about them, although now I would’ve preferred to have something a bit more interesting and made for Japanese people. Always choose a set of flashcards over any kind of kanji book. If you’re using a good set of flashcard, you don’t need to worry about the following thing. However, if you’re going to be manually looking up kanji through the power of the internet, there are several kanji orders you need to be aware of: By frequency of use. Don’t. Maybe after you know a few hundred, but this is definitely not the optimal place to start. By grade (order in which kanji are taught in Japanese schools). Probably the best place to start. In fact, this is pretty much the only officially existing order that makes sense and is also an actual order! Divided into grades (obviously) which you can use as milestones. By JLPT level. I never cared about JLPT and neither should you. My condolences if you are forced to take it at some point. This isn’t really an order but simply a way of organizing “all” kanji into 5 categories (levels). Inside the categories there is obviously no order: JLPT was designed for testing, not ordering. Designed shittily btw: tons or kanji you’ll be knowing by heart after just a few months of reading have somehow landed in N2 and N1 (levels go from N5 to N1), and if after a year of reading you take a look at N3 and even N4 kanji lists you are pretty much guaranteed to find something you have never seen before. Fuck JLPT. Jōyō kanji. You will be seeing this word a lot, so I guess it is sort of important to know what it is. This term refers to all “official” kanji, a government-curated kanji roster, so to speak. The jouyou (常用) part literally means normal/standard use. It’s just a list tho, not an order. Its order is pretty much random, depending on where (and when) you find it. I suggest wikipedia. If you think there would be like this big and beautiful official government website made just to list all 常用漢字 — think again."

    "body": "Why even read? Why not just listen? Don’t get me wrong: you can still become plenty fluent with nothing but variety shows as your immersion material. Especially if you watch them 24/7 for 5 years straight. However, you need a way of encountering rarer words: spoken vocabulary of any language is fairly limited compared to written. If you do nothing but listen to the “everyday language“, you’ll be learning 5-10 new Japanese words pretty much every day for the rest of your life (or, if you are a professional polyglot, ignoring yourself not understanding 50% of the language while claiming to be native-level fluent for the rest of your life). Find something to read in Japanese. It should be original (not translated/localized) content intended for native speakers (i.e. not for learners of the language). It can be virtually anything, but I strongly recommend manga, preferably with full furigana (or at least something with full furigana). Please don’t start with (light) novels: even video games with furigana would be a better starting point. Most likely you are going to have to torrent… pretty much everything. So execute a certain degree of caution. For all internet heroes out there: it is not stealing because the content you are getting is not available in your country anyway (or even if it is — not in the format you need). Plus, in 99% of cases even if you knew Japanese well enough to navigate through Japanese digital storefronts, they wouldn’t accept your payment method anyway. Even digital (🤦‍♂️) commerce is all regionally locked these days. Have you ever tried registering a Japanese PSN account and buying something with your credit card? Yeah. So calm your tits, pirate hunters. You may not realize it, but due to regional locking of content and bs politics of international distribution, most of all media content ever made can only be acquired by torrenting. The only tracker you are going to need for Japanese is called Nyaa. Just google it and the wikipedia page should tell you its current domain. Actually, don’t google anything: switch to DuckDuckGo if you would like a smaller and potentially slightly less evil company to pretend not to track you. If you are worried about your ISP spying on you, consider using a VPN. Free or paid — doesn’t really make much difference in terms of security (at the end of the day the paid ones can’t be trusted any more than the free ones, which is to say none of them can be trusted), but utilization will be slightly different. A paid VPN is likely to be as fast as your “open” connection, plus you can just leave it on forever. A free VPN is likely to be noticeably slower than your “open” connection, and (with a very few exceptions) you are going to be dealing with monthly data caps (still, should be more than enough if you use it just for exploring places with the good stuff). ThePiratebay is garbage fire: there is pretty much nothing there but porn ads and one billion dead listings. If you don’t know what torrenting is, I don’t think I can help you here any better than literally the entire rest of the internet at your disposal. The only recommendation I can give you is that client-wise you should probably go with qBitttorrent, and if somehow it slows down your computer to the point of it not even being operational anymore, go with uTorrent (its whole thing is that it’s supposed to be light, but the client itself has ads and the installer comes with optional bloatware disguised as non-optional. disgusting. but the client itself ain’t bad). Manga and comic books are often distributed in the CBZ/CBR archives, but even when it’s a simple ZIP/7z/RAR archive I still recommend using a dedicated reader for nerds — it’ll make the reading experience a lot better and easier. On PC and Mac I recommend taking a look at YACReader. On iOS the best free reader is iComix. I just checked and there is also a reader called iComics now — that’s not the one I’m talking about. update: I have several gripes with iComix now (still the best free reader on iOS tho). 🖕 (probably fixed in later versions but since my iPad is pretty old I cannot update the app) Occasionally ZIP archives just don’t import correctly. iComix will unpack it, but for each page it will create an empty one and put it at the start. So if there is 200 pages in the archive, in iComix it becomes 400, with first 200 containing nothing (which may trick you into thinking that the whole thing is broken, but it is not: the actual pages just start at 201). Not the end of the world, but the annoying part is that I have absolutely no idea what’s causing it. At first I thought it was the macOS’s hidden “dot” files. No. Then I thought I traced it down to pages being in sRGB. But no, that too got disproved eventually. Absolutely freakish bug. If it annoys you too much, there is another reader called ComicFlow that doesn’t have it (also free but a bit more jenky and significantly less slick, but totally usable and also without ads). In my experience hidden macOS’s files are not confusing iComix at all, so don’t waste your time trying to clean up archives of stuff that you can’t see. 🖕 If some ZIP archives unpack for you with random gibberish symbols in the file names where kanji and kana should — you need a better unarchiver. The thing, however, is that iComix needs one as well. Those archives will never import into iComix correctly (random pages will be missing, out of order, and they can even corrupt other perfectly fine archives importing with them in the same batch). Solution: unpack all archives on your computer first and re-pack them yourself before sending to iComix. 🖕 Same thing goes for archives that contain any files that iComix cannot read (safe for the hidden macOS files, and maybe even any hidden files period). If you didn’t compress the ZIP file yourself, definitely check it for garbage if you’re encountering problems: there is probably some txt or html file there with the releaser’s credentials. 🖕 Not being able to turn pages from right to left is more annoying than I initially thought. What’s even more annoying is that if you are in the 2-page landscape mode, since pages go from left to right — 2-page spreads are always ruined (the right page is always on the left, the left one is always on the right). 🖕 Not being able to rename “folders” is pretty stupid. Altho the app sorta automatically fixes this problem by allowing creation of new “folders” you can name… and yeah, you cannot rename those either. That’s first-party Apple app territory of having a jenky, unintentional, borderline lucky workaround to an extremely basic oversight. If you are looking for light novels, always prioritize text-based formats (as opposed to blurry scanned image file-based formats) like EPUB and 青空文庫. EPUB is a pretty universal formal for ebooks, and 青空文庫 is a format invented by a Japanese preservation library website of the same name (due to how easy it is to work with, it is used by other people as well now). Feel free to check out said library, by the way: it’s free, but it’s mostly pretty old stuff that went public domain. However, it obviously goes without saying, but: most books don’t have furigana, and older books are no exception. EPUB is very easy to open: most systems come with tools for that (example: iBooks for macOS and iOS), for any other system there are dozens of reader apps out there. If you have a hardware reader — EPUB is literally its main thing. Unless you are rocking a Kindle: I think without some hackage they only read the amazon’s proprietary format in which come the books you buy off the kindle store. What a great consumer-friendly piece of technology, can’t wait to buy the biggest, most expensive one. For 青空文庫 you are definitely going to have to find a reader app, and it’s even possible that it’ll come with Japanese-only interface. I don’t have a recommendation for you on this one: I only read on my iPad, which is pretty old and I actually can’t install new-ish apps on it (except for the ones I already have in “purchased”, in which case I’ll be allowed to download older versions). So the only old-ish 青空文庫 reader I could install is pretty old and a bit buggy: it doesn’t recognize the entire “package” of an 青空文庫 “file” — it only reads the text file portion of it — so you end up without images. You may occasionally find some books in just pure TXT format: an ebook reader will make sense of it, but you won’t get any furigana or even formatting (or images, obviously). You may find some older books in PDF (especially for children): those are usually pretty low-quality scans (partially due to being old — no one really does books in PDF these days), so unless it’s a book you are specifically looking for I don’t recommend bothering with anything in PDF. Also get Documents by Readdle if you are on iOS. OK, where was I? Oh, yeah. So… Read the piece of media you chose to the best of your ability: one word at a time, one sentence at time. This process is often referred to as “intensive reading”. I prefer calling it reading, because that’s how people read. The opposite, passive way of reading is called diagonal reading by normal people and “extensive reading” by ajatt&amp;friends. Reading is going to be your main way of mining, which is probably the most important part of acquiring vocab and grammar, which is kinda the whole point of immersion. Technically you can immerse without mining, but it doesn’t work very well for languages like Japanese and Chinese, where reading and speaking are absolutely separate skills. So how does reading in a language you don’t speak look? Use a dictionary to look up words that you don’t know. You could either take notes on the meanings and reading (for many-many words there could be dozens of meanings — try to condense your understanding of them to their essence), or just leave tabs open with all the words you are looking up and later add them to your SRS to learn and remember (you may think you’ve already just learned the word, but trust me — you haven’t, unless we are talking about something extremely basic, common (tree, dog, day, etc), or containing kanji/portions you know already). Also, since over time (a rather short time, to be honest) you are going to forget almost everything that is not in your SRS library (except for super basic/common things), you might as well don’t bother with the whole note taking and just add words to SRS. You ain’t going to take and review notes on 20000 words anyway, trust me. And also once you realize that you’ve forgotten pretty much all that is in your notes, you will probably want to add them all to SRS anyway. The hell is SRS? On that later, let’s finish reading first. For now let’s assume all your new words are sitting in open browser tabs. Use the power of the internet to look up grammar that you don’t know or that doesn’t make much (or any) sense to you. Just type the whatever grammar you want to learn about + the word “grammar”. I recommend having a notebook just for writing short lesson-like grammar explanations for yourself. Maybe bookmark the grammar explanation webpages that you had to look up more than once. To save yourself some sanity points, speed up the process, and start making your brain work in the essential for immersion way, once you’ve acquired a bit of vocabulary — start trying to figure out meanings of the words you don’t understand based on the context and surrounding words that you do understand. Half of the time — simply assume the meaning, or just say “eh, screw it”, flat out skip the word or even the sentence and move on to figuring out or mining the next thing. As long you can still follow the plot, occasional skip is not only acceptable but even recommended (even though I think you should only “skip” the words that you can figure on the fly). Otherwise the slow pace of reading like that will get rather demotivating and annoying. Also, when it is clear that you are looking at an expression I still recommend looking it up even if you know all the words in it (the whole thing is probably in the dictionary, and probably doesn’t mean what it looks like it means)."

    "body": "A HELPFUL TOOL THAT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS YOUR PARENTS ALREADY HAVE You probably do other things with your life other than actively studying. Only if your brain can handle it, try having something containing Japanese speech just playing on the background — podcasts, redtube, noflix, dramas/movies, etc. Passive immersion helps your brain to get used to the new phonetics, start distinguishing words from each other, and you’ll even pick up a random word or phrase here and there. All you need is audio, and it virtually doesn’t matter at all what it’s about. Don’t pay much attention to video (unless you want to). If you do though, and if you also try actively comprehending what is being said (without pausing and looking up everything you don’t understand) — don’t get hypnotized into doing it too much. It’s a bit of a time waster on early stages. Let things run on the background for at least a month or two while you get better at reading (or go through some grammar books) before going into active listening. I say do passive listening as much as you can as long as it doesn’t distract you too much. Apply moderation if it does. If you already can’t do anything, even play a game, without some random redtube rant playing on the background — you already have ADD, congratulations. At least you already know how to passively immerse. Might as well do it in your target language. On redtube or noflix — jumping into Japanese content is pretty self-explanatory (which account’s region to Japan). You can even find a few new-ish TV-like channels on redtube. Finding a good podcast can be a bit tricky but I recommend just downloading iTunes and browsing Podcasts with your region set to Japan — you’ll find plenty of stuff with zero trouble. If you can’t find tolerable redtube content to watch, you are probably just not ready for it yet. Maybe you should let it go: redtube really isn’t optimal for intensive immersion due to lack of subtitles (automatic ones don’t count) and non-customizable rewind (5 seconds is too much for a quick 1-word re-listen). And for passive immersion — redtube no better than any other option (noflix, podcasts, random torrented stuff). I am a pretty bad source for redtube channel recommendations. Over the years I unsubbed from way more channels than I am currently following. Most Japanese redtubers put the same hellish 5minutecrafts DIY music over every second of their videos, so until redtube/twatch/pornhub starts supporting a video format with multiple audio streams (one for mic, one for music, one for whatever the fuck else depending on the content) and allow viewers to mix them in real time, I just physically cannot watch 95% of Japanese redtubers, let alone Japanese twatchers (even passively) with their text-to-speech chats (not just donations): don’t even bother looking for good ones to have on background for passive immersion. I mostly follow music creators these days, and most of them aren’t even Japanese. What to immerse with, especially passively, is really something you should decide for yourself. If you aren’t really interested in anything… Why are you learning the language, again? If you absolutely need a starting place, I suppose I could recommend a few channels, but you should really find something you like. I semi-follow 乃木坂46 (nogizaka46) and the rest of the N46 projects. The first 1/3 of their variety show 乃木坂工事中 can still be found on nyaa. The new stuff in on redtube (乃木坂配信中 channel). Everything in-between is lost to history as far as I know (except for a dozen random episodes with 0.1 seeders on nyaa). If any of you knows where to find the entirety of the pre-redtube 乃木坂工事中, plz let me know. I assume it could be on some national Japanese trackers, but no normal people know of them so I don’t have anyone to ask, and web search obviously won’t tell me. I assume if this kind of information is not known in the wider western weeb community, such trackers may not even necessarily exist. I mean, even nyaa — the most popular weeb tracker — is mostly used by Japanese people. And it’s not even that big: most stuff there has either 0, 1, or under 5 seeders (except maybe for big music releases and fresh dramas). So if even the Japanese use what is considered a weeb tracker, there may actually not be anything else better out there. If you want to get into variety shows, N46’s stuff is one of the best places to start: the content is very much a real Japanese (unlike anime or heavily edited redtube videos), and it will teach you things about real Japanese people and Japanese sense of humor. Of course, for sociological research purposes season one of Terrace House would probably be a bit better, but Terrace House is very artsy: if you “watch” it passively you will mostly just be listening to either American pop music, or to nothing. With N46 content you can learn a ton of Japanese names through repetition, you get a long-running shenanigans with deep lore and history, and generally speaking the amount of content is practically infinite — N46 has been around for a decade. Partial subtitles are essentially built into most TV-ish content (and even basic redtube-ish content, to be honest), which is very convenient for active immersion, too. Also, I find it very appealing that while the show is silly and pointless by itself, it at least has ties to something meaningful — music (you’d be surprised how good it is btw, if you’ve only heard AKB48&amp;sisters). The show is hosted by a rather hilarious comedy duo バナナマン, and if you don’t know anything about N46 but have doubts about idol stuff based on what you know about AKB48: yes, business-wise the projects are similar, but trust me — they could not have been more different in spirit. N46’s content is borderline wholesome. Compared to 48G — the N46 groups are saint. Music-wise they are night and day, also: N46 is much more serious about the music part of their operation. I would even go as far as to say that their music is rather good, and not even just in the idol pop scene. By the way, the previous show 乃木坂46 did was called 乃木坂って、どこ？ and as of now can also be found of nyaa. Grab while you can. In case you are interested in music, the current N46 family is: 乃木坂46 日向坂46 櫻坂46 （formerly known as 欅坂46） All 48G (AKB48-related) projects are not only a collective garbage fire, but their redtube channels don’t even produce any content, really. There is probably some exclusive stuff behind pay walls (mostly softcore porn, I imagine) but I wouldn’t bother looking for an occasional unofficial upload of some of it to redtube. What content they have for free on their respective redtube channels is absolute trash. You can find some daytime TV-style 48G stuff on nyaa, but there isn’t a lot of it there, and I say it’s probably a good thing. Honestly? Don’t bother. If you hate N46, 48G stuff can legitimately damage your faith in humanity. If you like N46 — you will put 48G’s content somewhere between untasteful and disgusting. It partially has to do with direction of course, but also 48G has very big and obvious problems with casting: most 48G members have rather unlikable, entitled personalities (you will immediately question whether the word idol is even applicable there). It’s hard to hate them for that of course — we are talking about children — but why doesn’t N46 have this problem? Better environment (aka better direction, aka better grown-ups in the filming crew), but also better casting to begin with. I don’t think 48G does any actual TV stuff at the moment. Japan is pretty unanimously done with them at this point, plus their management company went bankrupt and all the different groups are currently being owned by… no idea who, to be honest. Various friends of Akimoto, I assume. Who too have no idea how to keep making money with 48G, I feel like. Remember PRODUCE48? Desperation was strong even back then. Imagine how they feel now that literally all of their “legendary” “talent” has “graduated”. NMB and NGT are actually not half bad musically. AKB, however, is the worst currently active idol group between Japan and Korea, and (maybe except for NMB and NGT) the rest of 48G is not much better (including HKT, the alma mater of the biggest mary sue in both Japanese and Korean idol industries). The whole thing can be described as talent void. It’s rather infuriating, to be honest: it’s a lose-lose scenario. On one hand it creates shit content no one cares about. On the other hand, the girls are obviously not getting payed much (or at all) and getting all the creeps, the hate, the drama, and no right for private life throughout their teens and twenties (which, I dunno about you, but definitely doesn’t sound like a disaster waiting to happen any moment to me). They all graduate at 25-30 with nothing but wasted (and in a lot of cases ruined) life: only top 1% of them may be popular enough to maybe attempt doing redtube semi-professionally. Most likely just porn though. Good luck starting life at 32 with no education, skills or talents, and probably widely known as a whore and a bully thanks to how Japanese press treats young women in entertainment. 48G were pretty endearing up until I would say about 7-8 years ago though (provided you ignored all the Akimoto’s barely legal pedo shit), but I guess that’s what you get when you have one perverted senile producer/songwriter responsible for pushing a dozen identical girl groups simultaneously for 20 years. He still has some good ideas though — the dude clearly knows a few things — but he sells most of those to N46. I don’t think we will never know whether Akimoto had any creative control over the disgusting 48G shit, and whether he was brought in to produce the N46 groups just for the company to look good for the investors (48G was like the most profitable thing in history of music at that point, or something like that) or because he legitimately wanted to start over with better, less perverted business partners. Since 48G and N46 are nothing alike in terms of casting and general level of morality, yet they have the same producer, I assume there was more to the immorality of 48G than just Akimoto’s touch. Or, maybe he is just being really thoroughly checked by his current management (which is pretty much Sony, by the way). Either way, N46 ftw. モー娘 (that’s how cool people say morning musume) family -related content is mostly boring af but musically I think their label is pretty strong (I keep forgetting their name though, I’m sorry &gt;.&lt;). Maybe not quite as creative as N46, but still very good… most of the time. If somehow you’re a fan, you might find some of this interesting. The groups are: アンジュルム （the good） モーニング娘。 （the legend） Juice=Juice （the still better than any 48G pedo bait group) The boring talking channels: https://www.youtube.com/c/helloprojectstation/videos https://www.youtube.com/c/omake/videos https://www.youtube.com/c/upcomi/videos https://www.youtube.com/c/tinytinytiny/videos こつぶちゃんねる is good. みるるんチャンネル is not bad (as far as low effort content from a lazy ex-idol can get you). may be the only ex-48G idol-turned-redtuber who has at least some kind of personality おっ!チャンネル is my spirit father. ぜぜまる。‘s content is pretty interesting. 遊牧ちゃんねる is occasionally interesting. ジョイ家 is both annoying and occasionally educational. Features a gaijin though, but her Japanese wouldn’t be especially bad for you: I feel like she’s been in Japan for a long time and she is the kind of person who makes a conscious effort to actually speak the language they are speaking and not just lazily mimic it using the phonetics of your native language (practice know in English as tkyosam’ing). The dude host is great though. GUNMA-17 is not bad but his channels are more or less dead now. 宮脇咲良‘s let’s plays and streams are actually really good. The channel may appear dead, but in truth it was never all that alive to begin with. She also has a dead non-gaming channel. 名取さな is the only other game streamer I could tolerate for her occasionally-on-point reactionary sense of humor. Not watching streams anymore tho. Too much water. Too much pointless blah-blah just to fill the air. Or the opposite — too much dead air. Annoying. Waste of time. There is way better content out there. Life is too short. I also don’t watch TV news type stuff anymore, even passively, except for occasional ウェザーニュース: it always delivers. Probably because it’s not a TV news channel. Care to guess what all news are about there days? All of these channels can be used for active immersion as well of course, but redtube sources (meaning, IRL Japanese) are not as good as scripted shows for it until you are fairly advanced. Music doesn’t count as passive immersion unless your name is Katsumoto, but from the attention amplification point of view I definitely see how you could listen to music when studying (to help yourself zone out), and to speech when doing chores and stuff. If somehow you aren’t a fan of Japanese music already, check out ヒトリエ, 緑黄色社会, Maximum the Hormone, Perfume, きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ and follow the rabbit hole from there. For podcast recommendations: Rebuild is by far my favorite one. You may want to skip a few especially gaijin-heavy episodes (and by skip I mean just not add them to the Rebuild playlist you have on constant replay), but generally speaking I love this podcast. If you need more, try さくら通信. You can also try ノウカノタネ, ポッドでラジオ, 愚者の宮殿 if you don’t mind podcasts with one minute-long loops of background music playing on endless repeat. If you ever find ひいきびいき somewhere, make sure you grab it and report to me. If you are into gaming you should know that IGN Japan’s podcast is mainly hosted by some American dude — not the Japanese you want to be immersing with. IGN is useless everywhere, I guess."

    "title": "Anki &amp; SRS",
    "keywords": "",
    "url": "/test/anki",
    "body": "If you actually read or actively watch/listen Japanese for several hours every day (if you do, I hope you know what you’re doing with your life), feel free to be skeptical about Anki and SRS until you need it: until you realize you keep looking up a substantial amount of words you can’t seem to remember. In other words: if you’ve been studying for some time and you’re still not doing SRS — I don’t necessarily blame you. But! Ultimately, you will either give up on Japanese, or start doing SRS. So if you’re serious about this whole adventure, you might as well download and start using Anki now. Anki will also be your insurance in case at some point you take a vacation from Japanese: and the sooner you start putting things into it, the bigger that insurance will be. So, again — you better start now. As you can see, at this point you are essentially writing your own language program: with words and grammar being taught in order of naturally encountering them in native writing. Pretty cool, eh? It may be time to start digitizing this custom dictionary of yours in order to make reviewing it less painful (you’re gonna wanna start doing it sooner or later). Why review? Because you’ll forget it otherwise. In fact, you’ve already forgotten most of what you looked up since you started Japanese. I recommend going with digital flashcards, preferably using the same shared database for your mobile and home devices (unless you absolutely don’t want that for some reason O_o). Myself and everyone I know are/were using a program called Anki for all our flashcards needs, so I can’t really say anything about other Space Repetition Software. I recommend looking up what Space Repetition is: it is more or less what Anki is built around, but you don’t really have to use the SRS component if you don’t want to. You do, though. I should probably preface the following guide with saying that Anki is mostly necessary for learning Japanese and Chinese languages. If the language you are learning is spelled in phonetic alphabet (like, you know, most languages) and it can be actually read rather than decoded: you don’t really need Anki. Just go ahead and read, you lucky bastard! So how does reviewing flashcards with Anki work? The idea is very simple. It will show you a card. It will make sure you remember it (short-term memory only, obviously). It will show it to you tomorrow. If you remember it — it will show it to you in 3 days. If you remember it in 3 days — it will show it to you in 5 days, and then in 10 days, and so forth. Gradually your memory of the word gets longer, i.e. stronger. At some point the interval will get too long and you won’t see the card for quite a while. You will fail a lot of those cards once they eventually come up. Every time you fail a card, its review interval resets and from there will grow slightly slower (so the cards you fail you see more often — makes sense, right?). However, when you fail a card with a long interval, its new interval will not be reset all the way to 1 day, but to something a bit longer: 3, 5, ever 10+ days, depending on how mature was the failed card. You can totally figure out Anki yourself, but here are a few tips: Anki is free on Mac-Linux-PC and Android (and I think it costs something on iOS) but you can only format your decks on Mac-Linux-PC! So even if you plan on exclusively using Anki on your phone (and you can), make sure to set it up on a computer first. Anki’s default flashcard formatting is way too small (makes especially little sense on mobile). You will want to set up a new deck and your own card type: Small update and disclaimer: I’ve actually been doing Anki again for the last 5 months because it’s 2021 as I’m typing this, and I couldn’t go back to Japan in 2020 as was planned, so I’ve been doing all other kinds of garbage to kinda survive where I’ve been stuck, so I haven’t been immersing all that much as of late. Remember the insurance part of being an Anki user? Yeah. So I am a bit lazy about taking new screenshots for this part: the ones used here I took after I thought I “graduated” Anki and before my return to Anki. So I didn’t have a deck at that specific moment. I am currently sitting at 6000+ cards and doing about 200 reviews a day, my deck is not called MAIN DECK and my interface is not in English 😉 I will now show you my old settings as an example of a starting point for a Japanese-learning Anki user: my current setting are actually not much different, but it doesn’t matter what they are anyway — I am sure you’ll come up with your own. However I did add a bit of a fun CSS gimmick for my deck that is not part of the following setting: I will demonstrate it later. You may like it. delete the default deck and create a new one; click Add. make sure the type is Basic and it’s your deck; click Fields. delete what’s there and create your own. you’ll probably need three: •  言葉　(word) •  読み方　(reading) •  意味　(meaning) Editing Font is literally just the font used in the previous window, not on the actual card. if you’re anything like me (and I know I am), just make it bigger for all three fields: 25-35. that’s all, you can close this window now. in Cards you do the actual formatting of the card template. every card has two sides: front and back. you need to add the fields you’ve just created to the sides of the card template. 言葉 goes on the front, then it also goes on the back (or you can just type {{FrontSide}}), and then separated by the &lt;hr id=answer&gt; tag goes 読み方 and 意味. when your Add Field, it adds inside a &lt;div&gt; tag. if you don’t erase it, it will override the central Styling field. so I suggest deleting it; Styling is the main default formatting for both sides of the card. if you want some elements to be styled differently, you need to do so inside the back and front fields (with &lt;div&gt; of &lt;span&gt; tags, for example) — it will override what’s in Styling; this is how my card template looks, feel free to copy it: Without furigana: in {{言葉}}, {{読み方}}, {{意味}} you won’t be able to add furigana to said fields, so feel free to add it to all of them (and not just {{読み方}} like I have on the screenshot). Cool, now when you know how to bend Anki to your will, if you sync this deck with the Anki cloud system and get it, say, downloaded onto your phone, you can add cards to it even on your phone and they’ll be in the proper formatting even tho you can’t really edit styling there. My styling looks like this on Mac: And like this on Android: Boom. Now you can finally add a test card in the +Add window by filling in the “editing” fields. To have furigana over a kanji or word, type it inside square brackets right after the kanji or word (no space) like this: 仕事[しごと]. Unfortunately, Japanese brackets 「」 and 『』won’t work so you will have to switch to English input every time to add furigana: It is better to assign furigana to specific kanji of the word rather than to the entire word: it’ll not only look cleaner but will help you remember kanji readings. So 仕事 I would do as 仕[し]事[ごと] rather than just 仕事[しごと] ; Another important moment. Furigana applies to everything after the brackets until either the previous brackets, the next &lt;div&gt;, or the end of the card. So if you have a word with okurigana in-between kanji, say 贈り物, if you type 贈[おく]り物[もの], もの will go over り物 instead of just 物 : To make sure this doesn’t happen put another set of brackets after り with english space inside of them like this: 贈[おく]り[ ]物[もの] : You can do that not only to “rogue okurigana”, but pretty much anything. Including spaces. Useful when you have several kanji for the same word. For example, you could have a card looking something like this: 影&lt;japanese space&gt;陰. And its 読み方 (reading) field would look like this: 影[かげ]&lt;japanese space&gt;[ ]陰[かげ]. And in 意味 (meaning) I would clarify that 影 and 陰 aren’t exactly the same thing: You can also just put english space instead of [ ] but I prefer the latter: depending on your system font a short english space can be much more difficult to notice than, you know, a [ ]. Makes it a lot easier to see what you are doing, which is helpful when you are doing long kanji compounds or sentences. You cannot, however, put [ ] after English space or you will end up with this: But you obviously need to put something before 石[いし] otherwise the space before it disappears: The answer is to just put double space before 石[いし] : To preview your cards: go to the main window, Browse, Whole Collection, click on the card, Preview. That is also one of two ways to review your cards in Anki without dealing with the SRS system: The other, slightly less jenky way (?), is to click on your deck in the main window, then click Custom Study, Study by car state or tag, All cards in random order (cram mode). This will create a new deck ready for review that you can delete later: To preview on Android, go to Card browser, long press a card, Preview: To create a custom study on Android, long press a deck, Custom study, Study a random selection of cards: Once you have spent enough time with Anki and understand how it works, you will start tweaking settings to your needs anyway. But in my opinion it’s never too early to address a few things in the deck options: It doesn’t make sense to have anything but 0 in New cards/day: you want to separate the actions of reviewing cards and learning cards. If you have anything in New card/day, Anki will randomly mix-in new cards with your reviews. That’s idiotic. Never do that. If Anki was a finished program, there would’ve beed a big fat obvious button somewhere saying Add New Cards to Queue. Maybe there is an add-on for that, I dunno. I just go to the options and set the amount of New card/day every time I want to study new cards, and once I’m done I go back and set it 0; Starting ease (controls how fast intervals are growing) of 250% is way too high in my opinion. Intervals grow to 4+ weeks way too fast, before you can remember most of them, so you’ll be “maturing” a lot of cards just to fail them in a month and start over; Everything else in my settings is pretty self-explanatory, so here are all of them. ESSENTIAL Anki add-ons: Batch Removal of Formatting. Because Anki is garbage. Make sure the config file includes tags &lt;span&gt; and &lt;font&gt; . example: STRIP_TAGS = ['span', 'font'] # list of html tags to remove Never remove &lt;div&gt; tags — that’s how desktop Anki does line breaks. Altho mobile Anki does line breaks with &lt;br&gt; for some reason. Probably because it was developer by different people. Yay open source. A must fix for the stupid default card scheduler. Install and forget. Don’t even read what is does. Reset Ease. To get yourself out of ease hell. You’ll know what it is once you’re there, trust me. When you copy and paste things into Anki — for some unknown reason it includes formatting, despite the fields of the Add window clearly being intended for pure text input. To paste into Anki without formatting, you need to use CMD+SHIFT+V. Standard Mac shortcut CMD+ALT+SHIFT+V for some unknown reason doesn’t work. I assume it’s CTRL instead of CMD if you’re on winflops (or on linux with winflops keyboard). Have I mentioned yet that there is a good reason why Anki is free despite providing an essential service to all language learners with free online storage? Yeah… For some reason the developer is completely disinterested in actually finishing it. If Anki wasn’t open source and add-ons didn’t exist: it would’ve been borderline unusable and competition would’ve destroyed it long ago. Even if it was free, without add-ons no one would’ve used it long term: everyone would’ve switched to something better at some point. You might’ve noticed that kanji are unreadably small in Browse. Unfortunately there is not a lot you can do about it, but you can increase the font a tiny little bit by going to Browse —&gt; Card —&gt; Options —&gt; Browser Appearance —&gt; Override font. I set mine to 15. Anything bigger breaks line spacing. I don’t recommend doing daily sentence SRS if you can spend the time you have for it on literally anything else in your target language. I obviously recommend doing word cards, while ajatt&amp;associates requires you to do sentence cards it order to be accepted into the cool 16 year-olds club. I… I am not a huge fan of sentence cards. Which makes me a mortal enemy of AJATT, and now I can never be friends with a bunch of zoomer weebs :-( My logic is very simple here: as long as you immerse — you’ll get your damn sentences, OK? Is it really that difficult to realize? Mining for sentences is just not worth the time investment (unless you have too much of it and literally no hobbies or interests): it takes a crap ton of time to make sentence cards. Or rather, it takes a crap ton of time to find “the perfect sentence” where there is only one word which you wish to learn surrounded by words that you know. Too much time. The redtube gurus though… they never had a problem with that, right? Well, of course it wasn’t a problem for them: coming across those perfect sentences happens way more naturally when you immerse 18 hours a day. Do you? So, while I do agree that doing sentence cards will give you good results eventually, I strongly believe that it’s not worth the time it takes to create them unless you have unlimited supply of it, i.e. your time is worth nothing. Concentrating on learning as many words as possible will give you better results: it will get you to the point of actually reading much faster (as opposed to just looking up words and calling it “reading”), which means you will faster get to the point of uninterruptedly comprehend what you read. And when do you learn, AJATT? C’mon, say it with me: when the input is comprehendible. The ability to read like a normal human being also means your are less interrupted by having to constantly look things up, which means less burnout, more enjoyment of the process, and more motivation to keep going. Do you think the AJATTers who “extensive-read” several light novels a day learn a lot from it? They are borderline just reviewing things they already know. It only works out in the end because they do it 120 hours a week. Cthulhu only knows how much faster some of those kids could’ve reached fluency if only they put a tad more thought into the process rather than just pure time and ego. Create as many cards as you can. If you’ve been studying the language for some time already, try to avoid basic things you already know by heart, of course. However. Are you sure you know how a standalone 紅 is read? Are you sure about how 春夏秋冬 is read? What about 九日 or 六日? Maybe not so basic after all. Everything you don’t know, as well as a good portion of what you think you know — create cards for it. I recommend keeping a separate browser window with jisho.org, opening each word you look up in a separate tab, and keeping that tab open until you create a card for it. At the end of some days I had 30 tabs open, other days it was 50 and even 80+ (especially when I bring in several days worth of tabs from my reading ipad). I’m not going to lie to you: it takes time to create cards for all these words. Not even close to 18 hours a day though. However do be careful: if you keep semi-passively immersing while working with cards, chances are you’ll be looking up stuff from said immersion, keep adding new words to your queue, and it can all become a never-ending cycle of violence that eats your entire day. Maybe shut the immersion off occasionally. Listen to some music. It’s good for you. Try to mostly create cards for words you feel like you’ll probably forget. Don’t spam your deck with every new word you encounter when you’re just starting out: as long as you keep immersing you’ll keep seeing common words anyway. Don’t use pre-made decks. I know it’s tempting. Don’t. I already told you to manually control the flow of new cards depending on your situation. For example, after getting to about 200 daily review you’ll start having days when adding 5 or even 0 new cards is a viable option if you already have 250 reviews tomorrow. If you are just starting out though, I recommend adding between 20 and 30 new cards a day. Anything below 20 is waaay too easy to false-positively remember (don’t quote me on this terminology) because the loop is just too short this way: you end up short-term-memory remembering™ all the cards in 5 minutes and then fail half of them the next day. If you’re properly aggressive in your card creation, you will always have a new cards backlog. Mine was 2000+ at one point. That’s what happens when you immerse a lot — you end up seeing too many new words to learn them all, your daily reviews go above 300 and you now hardly even have any time for immersion. Or life. So what happens next is that you’ll be looking up words that are already in your deck (I mean, as new cards waiting to be learned) and discovering that when trying to create new cards for them (Anki will tell you that a card like that exists already). You have several options when this happens. Option one: this word is obviously somewhat more common than the rest of the new cards you created around the same time: bump that card up to see it sooner. Right click on the card in the browser and choose Reposition. Make sure start position is 0 and shift position of existing cards is checked and press OK. The card is now #1 in the new cards queue. Option two: you realize that this word is actually really easy for you now. Maybe it consists of pretty basic kanji you’ve learned since you originally created this card. Or maybe you realize you actually know the word itself rather well: you just weren’t familiar with the spelling of it when you created the card, but it looks pretty straightforward to you now. Inject it. Injection™ is when you skip the whole “new card” thing: you pre-graduate a card and its first review. So, for example, with my settings a card like that can immediately be sent 3 days into the future (GOOD), 4 days (EASY), or 2 day (HARD). Injection is a good way of trimming the new cards backlog while not effecting you reviews tomorrow — so it can be done even if you already have more than enough things to do tomorrow. You can easily inject 100+ cards (spreading them between 2, 3, and 4 days ahead) without affecting the next day, while doing 100 new cards would likely destroy your tomorrow. Obviously it can also be done for cards that you have just created: for example, if the word is truly new to you, but you know its kanji and the reading is pretty straightforward. To be honest, in cases like that you’ve probably already remembered the word more of less forever, but I wouldn’t blame you for creating a card for it. Obviously, a card like that can be injected right away. The downside of injection, however, is that if you fail a freshly injected card you will see it tomorrow (and its ease is gonna go down, of course, since you essentially failed a graduated card). Failing a freshly injected card is actually a pretty good omen of failing it quite a lot in the nearest future until you learn it, by which time its ease is gonna be six feet under. That’s when you find yourself in “ease hell” and use the aforementioned Reset Ease to get out of it. To inject™ a card you right click it and choose Reschedule —&gt; place in review queue, 0, 0. OK. The secret Anki technique I mentioned before going over basic formatting options: putting the answer into a spoiler. For some reason this works not exactly how it should on mobile, but it’s even sorta cool. Just add this to Styling (in Browse —&gt; Cards): .answer { background-color: grey; color: grey; } .answer:hover { background-color: white; color: black; } And class = ‘answer’ to the opening &lt;div&gt; tag for Back Template. The tag should look something like this: &lt;div class = 'answer' style='font-family: arial; font-size: 30px;’&gt;{{意味}}&lt;/div&gt; This should put the “meaning” part of the card’s back side into a spoiler. For some reason on mobile it puts the entire back side into a spoiler, but it doesn’t really change anything because of how spoiler text works on mobile (you’ll see). Delete the part you added to Styling if you don’t want this highly sophisticated piece of software engineering. To the future, highly advanced you: for some stupid reason EASY and HARD buttons are missing from review ahead (through Custom Study), so by the time you’re confident enough with Anki to use the review ahead function and make your life a bit easier on certain days… using it will actually hurt you in the long run: EASY and HARD buttons get extremely important after a few months with Anki. I consider this a bug, to be honest. Maybe it’ll be fixed one day. Maybe it’s fixed already. Or maybe never. It’s Anki we are talking about. To the future, advanced you: stop failing every card because you can’t recall its meaning. If you can comfortably read a word but can’t quite remember what it means precisely — don’t fail that card. Recalling reading is the most important part anyway because that’s what allows you to painlessly look the word up when needed. Meaning, however, not only can but is in fact even better be figured out from context. Chances are it will be impossible for you to remember the meaning of this cursed word without context anyway. Also, most words have several pretty different meanings, but you will most likely remember only one. Which means without understanding context there could be situations where you can’t understand the word you (think you) know, or you could understand it incorrectly. Knowing ±1 meaning in a vacuum will not let you master a word. Even if the word has only one use, its meaning can probably be described by a few dozen English words. So only experiencing the word through many instances of context will give you its full meaning. Don’t obsess over “oh my god I can read this word but I totally forgot what it means! wtf is wrong with me?!”. Not much is wrong with you, actually. At least not in the context of this specific situation. It’s a totally normal thing when you learn a large volume of words fast. Be thankful to your brain for the ability to not only recognize the word but even read it: this ability is worth a lot, even if the inability to recall meaning is annoying af. You don’t need the meaning right now: this is just a word, not a complete thought (aka sentence). Give yourself a chance to deduct the meaning once you see, or maybe even hear, a sentence with this word. Consider pressing HARD more often on such cards (rather than failing them, I mean). Even if you don’t see this word in your immersion until its next review, you’re giving your brain a more relaxed chance to remember the meaning of it and allowing more new card to be learned instead of relearning this leech. Giving your brain a chance + learning new words &gt; being anal about re-learning old words. You could say “dude, feck off with that: it’s just one word, let me fail it”. Yes, it is but one word, but you’ll fail and re-learn hundreds of cards like that, over thousands and thousands of failed reviews. In fact at some point you’ll be failing dozens of mature cards a week, if not a day. Say you have 200 reviews a day: with optimal retention of about 75-80% it means you’ll be failing about 300 cards a week, which is a whopping 1200 cards a month. It’ll then take 2-3 reps for each card to get the interval back to over a month (provided you haven’t failed its first attempt at re-graduation and if the ease wasn’t already in the gutter). So you are looking at approximately 2500-3500 reps a month that you make yourself do simply by failing cards. Let’s say 25% of the cards you fail you do because you couldn’t recall the meaning: that costs you 800-900 reviews every month. Well, on average it takes about 3 reps to graduate a card. That’s about 300 additional new cards a month you could be adding if you simply stopped failing those 25% and gave your brain a fighting chance. I dunno about you, but to me learning 300 additional cards a month sounds pretty sweet. And if 25% sounds a bit much — just you wait, you’ll get there. However, even if it’s less than 10% you are still looking at graduating something like 100 additional cards a month. Still not bad. Do you want to rob yourself of that? You might say the newly graduated cards will then start taking up space in your reviews, just like the failed/re-graduated cards were, so in the end you may end up with even more reviews this way… But not really. Well, maybe a little bit. The point is the approach I’m proposing will provide you with a fresh and healthy amount of new cards in your reviews, rather than the doom and gloom of rotting in the swamp of same old failed re-re-re-re-graduated cards you don’t stands a chance remembering anyway (for which you need either context, or knowing more simpler words using same kanji. probably both). Even resetting ease will not save you from that rot if you keep being 100% anal about memorization. And yeah I sense the “gotcha!” moment coming from the sentence cards purists. No, sorry, no gotcha for you. Even if 50% of the card you fail you do because they require context to be remembered, that is 50% of 20-25% retention failure, which is 10-12% overall. 10-12% words that you can only master thru context? Yeah, I’ll take that, thank you. Anyone would have a fantastic time immersing by reading and watching stuff with subtitling while understanding “only” 90% of the language:   •  it’s not a giant ass pain that way;   •  you are actually reading, practicing comprehension, and learning things from context rather then spending 99% of the time just looking up words you can’t even read without furigana, let alone understand;   •  it will be actually enjoyable therefore you will want to do it. trust me, no matter what your levels of personal motivation and interest in Japan are, the tedium of mining is unescapable. So no, sorry: “supercharging your immersion with learning as many words as you can by memorizing literally every single new thing you see until you don’t have to flip through half a dictionary (metaphorically, hopefully) to read most sentences you encounter” is still more productive than “brute forcing your way through language with extensive immersion” (which only worked for people who had 18 hours a day to dedicate to it). Good for them, of course, and bless their hearts. I’ve even been there, with English. But now I’m old, have responsibilities, and learning a much more difficult language, so I have to be smarted about how I do things. Even if I had 18 hours a day for immersion, I would’ve probably still found rather interesting doing, say, 12 or even 8 instead of 18 for the same final result. So I don’t, and probably never will, accept the analness of the ajatt&amp;associates’ purists for anything but pubescent obsession. Also, I guess every language guru has to protect their method with everything they can. The only method that truly works, of course, or at least somehow magically optimized. All the other methods are just not as good, you see. Sentence cards is the only way because… well… we’ve all done it. And also we’ve all immersed for 18 hours a day. Now you have to repeat all of my steps otherwise the sacred method will not work. [it already won’t work unless you have half a day everyday to dedicate to just making sentence cards] Don’t you dare apply any reason or optimization to it! It’s funny how most ajatt&amp;friends’ gurus do admit that you don’t have to no-life their methods, because they realize they would never sell an 18-hour-a-day program to anyone. But they still protect the rest of their rituals with their lives… despite those rituals never working for anyone but them, who no-lifed the hell out of their “method”. Somehow the importance of that detail always eludes them: they always think “well, yeah ok this detail needs to change — obviously I can’t push for no-lifing, otherwise no one’s gonna listen to me” (partially because the only people who can no-life your overpriced program are 14 years old and can’t pay for it) “but everything else that happened to me had no connection to no-lifing anyway, so it has to stay the way I’ve done it. Yes, me. Mmm… me… I love me”. Start NOW. 10 new cards and 15 reviews a day take 10 minutes."

    "body": "After spending at least a few months building up vocabulary and grammar understanding, you can try doing active listening. Think of it as a sequel to intensive reading. You can also call it “intensive listening”, I suppose, but I refer to it as “active” to underline it being the opposite of “passive” (the technique I am about to talk about doesn’t come down to just actively paying attention to your immersion, though). Alternatively, you can spend however much time you want just doing reading and passive listening. A year, if you want. Would hardly be a waste. Especially if spoken Japanese isn’t your extremely time-sensitive priority. If it is though — yeah, depending on how fanatic you’ve been with the previous steps, you might be ready to dip your toes into active listening even after just a few months of reading. If you want and mentally capable of doing this as your main Japanese activity, it can completely replace reading (just mine using this method instead of reading). Find a piece of media like a TV/episodic show or a movie that is intended for native speakers and has Japanese subtitles. Yes, anime is totally fine. Preferably get something you can download and play locally on your computer (once again, you’re most likely going to have to torrent it): web players aren’t quite as good for what you need, but if you absolutely have to use some kind of netflix — it’s not a deal breaker. Also, use headphones whenever possible. If you are playing it back locally, configure your player so that you can easily jump back and forward an interval of about 3 seconds (even 5 would be too much). Control the player using the keyboard, obviously. I recommend VLC. It isn’t especially fantastic, but has a very solid feature set. Listen to the first line and immediately pause. Did you get it? Probably not. Read the subtitles. Did that help? Probably not. Skip back and listen one more time: try to follow the subtitles as the line is being spoken. If the sentence doesn’t make much sense to you, look up the words you don’t know and try understanding it to the best of your ability without going too deep into things like new grammar (just ignore confusing stuff as long as it’s not absolutely critical for understanding the meaning). Listen to the line a bunch more times simultaneously following the subtitles until you’re confident you are clearly making out all the words being said (a few dozen times even, if you have patience for it). Turn the subtitles off and play it one more time (just for testing, don’t do this every time!). Can you repeat it? Would you be able to write it down right now? Basically, what you just did was an extremely effective neural exercise that connects exact sounds you’ve just trained yourself to identify in a string against others to words you understand (or at least in the process of remembering). That’s the full package, isn’t it? Phonetics, meaning, spelling. Well, congratulations: you’ve just been told the secret to becoming fluent. Now do this for a few months and you’ll literally understand 100% of the language you are capable of understanding vocabulary- and grammar-wise: you’ll pretty much have native-level hearing. Some accents will be throwing you off of course, but only time and experience can remedy that. Guess what: accents are throwing off natives as well. A lot. Don’t worry about it. Similar to how I recommended with reading practice, try to extract meaning from context as much as you can before looking things up (and even instead of looking up — just make an assumption, risk being wrong — who cares? you’ll correct yourself the next time you encounter this word and realize that it doesn’t make sense the way you understood it last time). Also feel free to completely skip some of the stuff that has just too much stuff to look up: if fact, do it quite often to save yourself some sanity here and there. Moving forward is extremely important: even if sometimes it means skipping a sentence with that sweet new knowledge waiting to be mined. If there is too much of it there, you will probably not process it all anyway (i.e. forget immediately). Remember: if you feel like you are missing out on truly appreciating what you are watching by skipping too much of it, you can always rewatch stuff later when you’re closer to fluency (right now, with constant pausing and rewinding, you’re not in the “appreciating” territory anyway). In fact, you probably should. Depending on how much time and effort you put into this, at some point you’ll be pausing-reading-rewinding-playing out of habit rather than necessity. The thing you need to be on the lookout for is this: as soon as you realize you pretty much hear and identify all the words even if you don’t necessarily get final meanings of sentences — it’s a sign that you can finally start saying goodbye to subtitles. Try doing the same thing you’ve been doing but turn the subtitles off. The next step is the most challenging one — start eliminating pausing. Let as many lines as you can go by as long as you can follow the plot and pause only when you absolutely have to (or want). Maybe go back to some of the content you went though in the past and see if you can now watch it as a normal human being. Having trouble finding stuff with subtitles? Nyaa, search bar: jpn sub / jap sub / jp sub. Try all three options, at least one of them will give you a lot of results. Of course if we are talking anime you can find lots of subs on kitsunekko.net. If their subs aren’t timed correctly for the version of the anime that you have, you can offset them in VLC with the delay function (just fyi, you really should have the VLC’s HUD on for that, in case you have it off), but I must warn you that for some reason offsetting subs timing in VLC makes the player run reeeally laggy. Even Light Alloy could do that 20 years ago, and everything worked not only smoothly but was also 50 times easier to do (offsetting subs, I mean). Unfortunately, you don’t really have many other options these days, let alone better ones. Don’t forget that you can modify the subtitles’ formatting in VLC. If subs don’t display correctly, try changing default encoding to Japanese Unix or other similar options."

    "body": "Try changing your computer and phone languages to Japanese. Can you handle it? If yes, keep it this way for the foreseeable future. Maybe do the same thing with the Anki interface, facefuck, twatter, redtube, neflops, etc. Well… since you are probably going to be using redtube a lot and you are already very familiar with its interface, you should probably switch it to Japanese now. Do you play video games? Unless absolutely impossible, keep them in Japanese as well. Speaking of being a giant nerd… If you like video games you may be wondering how soon can you start diving into Japanese gaming. I would say pretty soon, but I don’t know if you would call it gaming: if you plan on understanding things like dialogue and plot ― you are still going to mostly just sentence mine. Personally, I was fine with it — maybe you’ll be too. The word “gaming” doesn’t fit perfectly here though. The first thing you should probably look for is furigana, especially if you actually want to game at least a little bit and not just mine. Unfortunately, 99% of Japanese video games don’t have furigana. In fact, I don’t remember ever seeing a proper PS4, PSP, or a PS Vita game that had it (except for maybe MonHan Stories 2?). There are a few Switch ones maybe? Anyway: you’ve got plenty of options only if you’re willing to make 3DS your console of choice for the next few years. OK, the actual first thing you need to look for is not furigana, but a Japanese 3DS, since if I’m remembering correctly 3DS is regionally locked. You can try hacking your console of course, but just like with hacking Switch — the final result is a bit jenky (it’s no hacked PSP experience, unfortunately). Also I have no idea where to pirate Japanese roms for 3DS, so I can’t help you with that. By the way, don’t get the literal 3DS or 3DS LL, and especially don’t get the “New” version of the system: there’s like one game that actually requires it, and but a few other games utilize its new thumb torturing nipple (Nintendo’s best attempt at giving the 3DS a second stick). Because of the way the 3DS’ screen works (you’ll never be using the 3D thing btw), it is very blurry in the 2D mode: basically it’s just two screens, one at a certain distance on top of the other, and for the 2D mode they come together, making a flat image. However, they aren’t aligned properly (probably on purpose, due to some phase-related shenanigans), which results in an absolutely insulting level of blurriness (and colors are off too btw) — since you will mostly be using the device for reading (essentialy), you definitely don’t need any of that. If you ever saw the screen of a 3DS console (especially the big one) and thought it was blurry af — the screen is actually pretty sharp when it’s not in the “two overlapping misaligned screens” mode. It’s pixelated, yes, but sharp. Get yourself a 2DS LL. A regular 2DS would be the next best thing, but I wouldn’t particularly recommend it unless you just need a spare console to trade Pokemon with yourself (I wouldn’t know anything about that…). Now! Here’s some good stuff that has furigana: とびだせ　どうぶつの森 (some other どうぶつの森 have it as well if I’m remembering correctly) 真・女神転生IV (not IV FINAL tho) ― the best game in the franchise ゼルダの伝説 games (on the original DS as well) 新・光神話 パルテナの鏡 (don’t break your arm with this one) レイトン教授 games, even レイトン教授VS逆転裁判 (don’t know about furigana in the non-3DS games) モンスターハンター ストーリーズ (not bad at all) 妖怪ウォッチ games (more or less all of them, I think). super cool and very underappreciated games btw ニの国 (the original DS game. don’t know about the “big” version on PS4) ドラゴンクエストVII &amp; ドラゴンクエストVIII (don’t know if the home console versions have furigana though) I don’t remember any 牧場物語 games having furigana, but the (currently) last spinoff ドラえもんのび太の牧場物語 looks like it has full support. The game is on the Switch and PC. Haven’t played it myself, but it’s probably pretty good (I mean, it’s a 牧場物語 game after all) and should be A-OK for learning purposes. Pokemon games can be played in full kana. Not really the same thing as furigana, but if you’re into gaming ― hey, at least it’s playable! In Japanese, technically. Would you do any learning with nothing but kana? Well, maybe a little bit. Definitely not a lot though. No proper 逆転裁判 game has furigana ― don’t get you hopes by レイトン教授VS逆転裁判. Obviously you can find some more stuff if you ask the interwebs for games with furigana. Not a lot, but some. I think?"

In the perfect world I would’ve used Firefox, but unfortunately in the real world Firefox is the slowest moving object in the known universe (almost unparalleled on mobile though, because it supports extentions). I personally use Chromium (of the Ungoogled variety) on desktop and Firefox of mobile. However, sync can be an essential feature when you are creating Anki cards from 50+ tabs on your phone or tablet (to quickly bring them to the desktop browser and make your life a little easier), so I would probably recommend using either Chromium with Google API or Chrome on desktop + Chrome on mobile, or just Firefox on both desktop and mobile. I somehow sync isn’t something you need and you don’t like mobile Firefox, another mobile browser to concider is called Kiwi (also supports extentions and is even slightly faster that FIrefox because it’s a Chromium reskin).

You can get a stable Chromium with Google API keys (which will enable the Google sync function) and support of open source codecs here (as well as potentially slightly enhanced build of UC), but it still won’t play noflix, spoopify, amazon streaming services, etc without some tinkering, at which point you might as well just use Chrome. Maybe somebody can explain why Chromium+Google API is better than Chrome (other than it doesn’t update automatically), but that somebody is not my stupid ass. If you don’t need sync or netflops (waste of money, really), just get Ungoogled Chromium, of course. This is how to install extensions for it. In addition to uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger, the third absolute essential extension for me is something like Dark Mode. Some browsers (like Vivaldi) have a “force dark mode” button tho, but definitely not Chromium (or Chrome, of course, since Chrome is just Chromium with Google’s spyware). Another function Vivaldi comes with and no other browser does natively — the ability to Open New Tabs Next to Current one (instead of opening them in random places). Not sure about all of the Chromium reskins, but Chrome and Chromium absolutely need this: YouTube Control Fix. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work flawlessly: every now and again I get the bug it is supposed to be “fixing” anyway. Without the fix, however, I get the bug every time I click on a browser window with redtube (from another window) and try to rewind. Can confirm Vivaldi having this bug as well. Every browser’s new tab page sucks: I use Infinity New Tab. If you are using Chromium on Linux, you may need this: Linux Scroll Speed Fix. Obviously don’t use Google search unless you somehow absolutely cannot help it. DuckDuckGo is currently the best alternative. Uncancerring YourTube the most important thing you can do to your browser for immersion First of all, you unsubscribe from everything English, except for maybe musicians (the real ones, not the music-related redtubers) or any other artist whose content is not based on them talking you ear off. Then go to settings and change your location to Japan. If you’ve already been studying Japanese for longer than 2 months, change the language to Japanese as well. There is never a good excuse to not know words like 登録 or 高評価, and switching redtube to Japanese is borderline the only way to learn those anyway: so I don’t think it can ever be too early for the switch — it’s highly doubtful anything in your immersion can prepare you to Japanese website UI-related terminology. Now. Redtube needs Jesus. There is way too much cancer (that’s really not good for you) and distractions for productive application of your limited time on this website. Use Unhook. It removes distractions from the website. Not unlike something you can do yourself by manually blocking elements with uBlock Origin. Only with Unhook it takes 10 seconds instead of half a day and is easily reconfigurable on the fly (which parts you want to block, etc). You can then use uBlock Origin to block the rest of the garbage on the screen. My redtube “home” page is just the subscriptions page, and this is the entirety of a video page (there is nothing below it): If you don’t think this is liberating and refreshing, and the non-uncancerred redtube is much better — consider not using this website for immersion: you’re not going to do a lot of productive things on it. One thing to note. Redtube never stops devolving, so certain extensions may interfere with each other or just randomly stop working correctly. For example, Unhook’s Home Redirecting is broken atm if you also use the next extension I will be talking about (PocketTube), so you need to disable that option (if you end up using PocketTube, I mean). The nature of the current bug is that Unhook keeps redirecting you to your sub page when you try open videos. Pretty much every time. That’s a bit too much uncancerring, I think. But how am I going to discover new channels? 😦 By using the search function. And also from collabs with the channels you are already subbed to. I don’t trust myself to use the uncleaned redtube in productive ways. Do you trust yourself? You shouldn’t. But what if I really really really care about these totally not cancerous English channels I’m following? Just look them up manually when you absolutely have to. You’ll be surprised by how few channels you’ll be doing that for. Those are the ones you could maybe perhaps actually care about: the rest were just leeches on your brain. I ask you to consider not putting them back on. Use PocketTube: Youtube Subscription Manager if you want to be able to organize your subscriptions (sort them into folders, arrange the order of channels on the left UI panel, etc). Extremely useful. Redtube itself provides literally no tools for things like that (I assume they don’t have enough money for it). At the moment is completely broken, but could be fixed by the time you read this. Also use BlockTube to block everything unholy from search results (not just videos — you can block entire channels with it). You can also prematurely block channels and videos based on keywords (also comments, but by now you’re not supposed to have comments at all). Are you trying to read something when paused on Redtube or Twatch but the player’s UI is in the way? On Twatch use uBlock Origin’s block element right on the paused video: that will remove the dark overlay preventing you from seeing things. For the rest of the interface: when in theater mode, the interface is tied to the edges of the window rather than the edges of the video itself, so if you just resize the window to be narrower than the video, the UI will be above and below it instead of right on top of it. To hide interface on Redtube: hyde. You can remove many other stupid things with uBlock Origin: remember how websites love to have some kind of splash screen blocking you from viewing/interacting with the page until you give them your phone number or just generally consent to your personal information being sold to the highest bidder? Yep, most of those screens are easily removable. No need to click on any OK, I AGREE or SURE, GO AHEAD AND PROFIT OFF MY PERSONAL DATA. After you are done with all that, consider cleaning the rest of the SNS websites you’re using (I mean manually, with uBlock Origin) and switching languages/regions to Japanese/Japan. Not everything is cleanable of course, and also websites can occasionally break during uncancerring. Or even after uncancerring, of course, if/when the UI gets updated. When it happens — go to uBlock’s setting, *My filters, and disable things one by one (by adding, say, // to the front of the string) until you find exactly which filter breaks the website (you may end up having to allow that element, unfortunately). Also don’t forget that your rules/settings/whatevers for pretty much all of those extensions can be exported and imported (even Infinity New Tab). So you don’t have to manually re-do everything when you switch browsers. On a side note… I honestly don’t even know if it’s possible to uncancer twatter feed from random garbage. Twitter is very sneaky in how in hijacks the feed: usually it shows you a crap ton of cancer first, but if you refresh the page it all goes away and for a while you only get normal tweets from your follows. In addition to unfollowing all the random useless people you don’t even know and manually blocking a bunch of elements with uBlock Origin, there used to be this method: adding these to your muted words: suggest_who_to_follow suggest_recap suggest_recycled_tweet suggest_recycled_tweet_inline suggest_activity_tweet suggest_pyle_tweet suggest_ranked_timeline_tweet @ RT However, these don’t really work anymore (or at least definitely most of them don’t). You can also try adding twitter.com##.flex-module to the uBlock’s filters. I’ve done all of these methods and I’m still getting shit like replies from strangers that my follows receive. If you know how to remove all that from the feed, please let me know. Windows and Japanese there is a small problem As long as you are using it, of course. You see, despite being unusable and terrible, winflops does have one huge positive quality: you in fact, totally for reals, don’t have to use it. I recommend at least trying Linux by, say, downloading VMware Workstation and installing Mint or Ubuntu because of the following situation with Windows. If you do decide to use winflops for studying Japanese, you might notice that the system renders Chinese/Japanese characters like complete ass. I don’t think I would’ve gotten anywhere with Japanese if I wasn’t on Mac or Linux. Like, if you’ve ever seen how Japanese text looks say, in video games — apparently that is something completely out of Microsoft’s league. That is not how Japanese text will look in your system. Winflops fonts are… bizarre. It’s not even the fonts themselves as much as how jenky they are rendered: it is sad and painful. On win7 Japanese font was even worse: it was absolutely unreadable. It was ugly, one-pixel-thin aliased nightmare. Well, it is slightly thicker now on win10 (lol does anyone use 11?) but for some reason it is still aliased af, as well as weirdly boxy and still very ugly. If you want things to feel a bit better, you can try installing MacType. It made things a bit more tolerable for me, but that’s not saying a lot since I don’t use winflops all that often anyway. When I am finally leaving macOS, I’m definitely going Linux for productivity: there is no way I am fully switching to winflops. Unless Apple wants to sponsor me of course — as a musician I’ll shill for Apple ecosystem 7 days a week: good luck getting anything audio-related done on Linux (you won’t notice any problems unless you are an audio person, so don’t worry about). The only thing transitioning to winflops from mac will be music production (and that’ll be win7 btw) — for literally everything else Linux is 1000 times better. If you are not on Linux or Mac already, you should reconsider your priorities: all you need winflops for are those video playthings for children you can’t live without, right? Well, no one’s taking that away. I am also not saying you should throw away your PC and invest into an underpowered overpriced Mac. Installing Linux alongside winflops and just trying it out will cost you absolutely nothing. Unlike with winflops, by the way, most Linux distros can be tried out without installing. Also virtual machines are a thing that exists. Linux distros constantly switch places in terms of who sucks the most this week, so I recommend doing a bit of research (not a lot tho, at the end of the day they are all the same). There is always one new hot distro on the market receiving everyone’s praise. For example, at the moment it’s Pop!_OS. I don’t recommend you go with the hot option. Pop!_OS is the perfect example why. The current latest version of the system comes with seven Japanese input methods all of which are broken and you have to install the correct one manually. For comparison, even win7 had at least one semi-working Japanese method… which for some reason kept switching to roumaji… but it least in theory it was usable, OK! Now, installing the proper Japanese input method was actually super easy, but I wouldn’t expect anyone to know how it’s done. Especially if you are switching to Linux without much experience with Japanese computing in general — you’d probably just get stuck confused with the seven broken input methods before giving up on Linux altogether. Also, half the system is still in English once you switch its language to Japanese, and what Japanese there is looks a bit sloppy in places. So to sum up, I don’t see how Pop!_OS is any better for you and I than, say, Ubuntu. If you want more winflops-like experience, go with Linux Mint (Cinnamon UI is a bit more win10-ish, MATE for a bit more win7-ish). Android and Japanese Let’s do a simple test. Take a look at this character: 令 This is a picture of how it should look for you: Here’s a link you can try opening: https://jisho.org/search/%E4%BB%A4%20%23kanji If on your phone it looks different — it shows you Chinese characters instead of Japanese. Probably because your phone is a non-international version of itself your bought from a Chinese vendor on ebay. To rectify this problem there are apps like Kanji Fix. I also recommend it if Japanese characters (including kana) on your phone look like they are in comic sans (disgusting). That shite does not only look ridiculous: it is actually pretty straining to read in my opinion. Kanji Fix allows to choose between the default comic sans android font and the one normal human beings should be using. Kanji Fix does require root access tho: my phone was already rooted so it wasn’t a problem for me. If you don’t know what rooting an Android phone is, your phone is probably not rooted. Think of it as activating developer mode: something that allows for things in your system to be actually modified rather than just played with. The procedure is different for each phone, so you’ll have to search for it yourself. On most modern Android phones there is like one button for it somewhere in the system preferences. There could be some strange requirements attached to it tho: for example my phone manufacturer (meizu) wanted my email and phone number if I wished to press said button. As if they don’t already know all of my emails and phone numbers. Ignore idiots giving you reasons why you shouldn’t root. Turns out on Android 7.0+ you don’t need Kanji Fix (unless you want to fix the comic sans problem). You just need to add Japanese to your language list in Settings —&gt; Languages &amp; Input —&gt; Languages. If you get similar problem on Windows, go into your browser’s font settings and choose Meiryo as the default font for everything. On MacOS, chose Hiragino Sans."

    "body": "I am sorry but this going to be very short. There is really not a lot to talk about here. If you’ve been doing passive listening this entire time, it probably started making a lot more sense quite some time ago. Start doing it actively — redtube, podcasts, maybe even streams — it has raw, unfiltered, unscripted Japanese. Whatever type and themed content rubs your fancy, but I’d suggest at least trying let’s plays or gaming streams (if can find any good ones). Live language will be quite a bit faster and harder to understand, but you will still be getting most of it. You may encounter some new slang: look it up if you have to. Obviously don’t pause anything: just power through it. In a few months you’ll be effortlessly (and automatically) understanding actual conversational Japanese on borderline the same level you do English. Aaand since it’s Japanese we’re talking about, at the same time your reading may still not be even close to that. Gotta love that near complete separation between reading and listening abilities. Don’t worry about it."

    "body": "Once you fluently comprehend input, in case you somehow don’t realize it sooner, you’ll find out that you are actually pretty OK at outputting — calling you semi-fluent would almost be an understatement. However, if you want to get a lot better, you are going to need practice. Things you can do that don’t involve moving to Japan and getting tons of Japanese “friends” who are only interested in practicing their English on you are: talking to yourself, a lot. not joking; starting a podcast. even if it’s shitty — who cares? do it for yourself, don’t even publish it; streaming. pretty much the same as podcasting but also a great exercise in multitasking. I don’t really recommend doing redtube unless you for some reason want to get good at writing — I imagine making video essays might be good for that. Otherwise, making videos is mostly writing scripts and editing. Maybe just stream and edit clips/highlights into videos? To sum up, the fastest you can become fluent in Japanese (to about a 中の下 native Japanese level*) is about 18-24 months: 1-3 months for basics; 1-3 months for studying at least a little bit of kanji (therefore, getting at least some vocab) and grammar; 3-6 months for reading, vocab and grammar mining; 3-6 months for active listening (+ vocab and grammar mining); 3-6 months for general hardcore-ish immersion (+ some vocab mining). *Dealing with Japanese is effortless and you understand pretty much 100% of the normal everyday use of the language. However, you still absolutely hate dealing with large concentrations of kanji (yes, this is absolutely a trait of an average Japanese person), and may even feel completely illiterate at times. However, being illiterate may not bother you at all if you are a narcissistic psychopath like Ken Cannon, MattVsPortland (or even my beloved George Trombley, who will at least be honest about it though, and will call himself out first on his shortcomings, not so different from what I’m always trying to do as an educator). If you don’t live in Japan and ALL you want to do with your life is watch anime — you don’t really need much reading skill. Just watch anime without subtitles for about a year and you’ll be 90-95% fluent. You will have a pretty shitty vocabulary but you will be understanding enough to afford ignoring pretty much everything that you don’t understand and still comprehend sentences. In fact, you will probably even develop an unconscious skill of literally not even noticing the things you don’t know (your brain will be taking them for noise and disregarding without telling you). Just use yomichan every time you need to read something online. And read manga with furigana. And of course you will absolutely be capable of daily conversation with Japanese people. You will feel fluent, and feeling good is all a narcissist needs. If you move to Japan like that though, you will be totally screwed, hence most MattVSPortland type of gurus don’t live in Japan and don’t even have much desire to go there: their kind of Japan exists only on the other side of a PC monitor. Depending on what you plan on doing with your life (therefore, depending on what you need Japanese for) and what level of appreciation you personally want to experience for the Japanese culture and her people, you can either view literacy as a part of fluency (which you are free to argue about, but it is in Japan) or as but an optional skill. I cannot tell you what to think and what your virtues are: I am not your guru. At least one of those 3-6 months periods is guaranteed to be 6, as well as at least one of the 1-3 periods to be 3. If 18-24 months sounds way too crazy, you should know that the data indicates pretty much exactly that. You are of course free to believe in “traditional” academic study if you like the idea of studying one language your entire life. If you want actual madness, you can listen to some of the “mainstream” celebrity polyglots, preferably on the background, while you are doing something at least moderately productive. They will tell you beautiful stories about how you only need a couple of months at best, but probably even weeks, to become fluent in any language. Their definition of fluency is pretty much just the state in which you have memorized a lot of phrases in the target language and you can kinda mimic how they are supposed to sound with English phonetics while looking like a complete clown. So it’s no wonder when a real polyglot gives their two cents on any language-related topic — no one’s listening. I guess it serves the academic lingo industry well to have the polyglot community represented by borderline insane people. There may even be some sort of conspiracy at play, I dunno. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions (only $420.69 a question). Good hunting! Thank you for checking out my insane ramblings."

    "body": "YOU MIGHT FIND HELPFUL ず, づ, and the magic D Are ず and ざ pronounced as Z and ZA or is it DZU and DZA? Also, is づ by any chance supposed to be DZU and ず — ZU? No. Unfortunately, both ず and づ can be pronounced as both ZU and DZU depending on… in most cases literally nothing but the speaker’s preference (potentially dialect, but unlikely). Are there words that HAVE to be pronounced with either ZU or DZU, and can NEVER use the other? Honestly? No idea. This is not a grammar book! Of the top of my head — completely interchangeable. If you have to output early tho, just stick to ZU. Maybe unless you are, say, shadowing a teacher who is clearly pronouncing DZU. Of course you can apply everything I stated in this paragraph to ZA and DZA, ZE and DZE, etc. Some people just like saying 全然 as DZEN–DZEN. Others say ZEN–ZEN. Why? Well… ——&gt; Much like how monolingual native Japanese speakers don’t notice when they shift between R-ish and L-ish way of pronouncing らりるれろ, I suspect they may not be noticing any difference at all between Z and DZ. Obviously there is also a pretty big confusion about じ and ぢ being identical or not, but that one is much easier to answer concretely: they are. SH is not a letter When typing in Japanese, don’t actually type things like chi, tsu, sho, cha, etc. Your computer will of course still understand you when converting to kana and kanji, but that romanization is technically incorrect, i.e. it is not how the Japanese people write in romaji. Which is probably something you should know, don’t you think? The romanization you are familiar with is useful when teaching Japanese phonetics to English-speaking foreigners, but that’s not how the Japanese people think nor how they use their keyboards. For them chi is not some kind of special sound that goes after ta: it is literally just the proper way of saying t + い. Same goes for tsu — that’s just how t + う is supposed to sound to a Japanese speaker. And of course the Japanese don’t see anything special about し: it’s just a totally natural s + い sound to them. Adopt the Japanese way. It will help. A little bit. First of all, you will definitely be seeing romaji used the correct way all the time, so you might as well accept it and convert now. But also, if you even have to output romaji (which could happen, right?) using the correct way will make you look much cooler than the incorrect one (big shocker!). つ　＝　tu tsu ち　＝　ti chi し　＝　si shi ちゃ　＝　tya cha ちょ　＝　tyo cho ちゅ　＝　tyu chu しゃ　＝　sya sha しょ　＝　syo sho しゅ　＝　syu shu etc Say せい again? Yet another thing that no book or teacher will tell you, which wouldn’t hurt to know from as early on as possible, is that い coming after せ (as in せい) pretty much always just prolongs the e sound of せ rather than reads as i. For example せんせい isn’t actually pronounced as sensei: it’s more like sense— (せんせー), with prolonged e of the second せ. You can on occasion sorta hear there being a reeeally short and timid い at the end… and in reality that’s probably the case, even though half the time I attribute that to my imagination. Check out for yourself and tell me if there is い in this word: https://jisho.org/search/%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F How い even further turns into え in colloquial use you can discover on your own: there is little need for a master class on いい becoming ええ, すごい turning into すげえ, etc. Although the phenomenas are clearly related, so I felt like I had to mention that."
